Build a Flask + SQLite web app: “Cold Email Lead Dashboard”

User Roles:
1) Admin
2) Sales Manager
3) Email Marketer

Purpose:
Email Marketers submit leads. Sales Managers review and accept/reject. Admins manage users, services, and all data.

Lead Form Fields:
- Lead Submitted By (auto: logged-in user’s name)
- Lead Creation Date & Time (auto: current timestamp)
- Full Name
- Email ID
- Phone Number
- Company Name
- Domain Name
- Services Pitched (multi-select): Design & Development, SEO, SMO, PPC, Digital Marketing, Mobile App
  * Admin/Sales Manager can add new services
- Country, State, City
- Attachment (file upload)

Lead Workflow & Permissions:
- Default lead status = “Pending”
- Email Marketer:
  * Can create leads
  * Can view only their own leads and their statuses
  * If a lead is “Rejected”, they can view the rejection comment and “Resubmit” with their own rectification comment. Resubmission sets status to “Resubmitted/Pending Review”.
- Sales Manager:
  * Can view all leads
  * Can Accept or Reject a lead
  * On Reject, must write a “Rejection Comment” (required)
  * Can manage Services (add new services)
  * Can export leads (CSV)
- Admin:
  * Full access: users, services, all leads, exports
  * CRUD for users (set role: admin/manager/marketer)

Notifications:
- When a lead is Rejected, notify the submitting Email Marketer (in-app notification and mark the lead in their list).
- When a lead is Accepted, mark as “Accepted”.
- When a lead is Resubmitted by the Email Marketer, notify Sales Manager for re-review.

Data Model (suggested):
- users(id, name, email, password_hash, role)
- services(id, name)
- leads(id, submitted_by_user_id, created_at, full_name, email, phone, company, domain, services_csv, country, state, city, attachment_path, status[Pending|Rejected|Accepted|Resubmitted])
- lead_notes(id, lead_id, author_user_id, note_type[rejection|resubmission|system], message, created_at)

UX:
- Role-based nav
- Lead table with filters (status, date range, service, submitter)
- Lead detail page showing comments/history (rejection & resubmission notes)
- Simple, responsive styling (Bootstrap or Tailwind)

Security:
- Flask-Login for auth
- Role-based access control on routes
- File uploads stored safely with secure filenames (16MB limit is fine)

Deliverables:
- Flask app with templates (Jinja2), static CSS
- Seed users: admin@example.com/admin123, manager@example.com/manager123, marketer@example.com/marketer123
- Seed default services listed above
- Export leads to CSV (Manager/Admin)
